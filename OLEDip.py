# OLEDtext.py
 
# This Python code is meant for use with the Raspberry Pi and Adafruit's monochrome displays!
 
# This program is the simplest in the whole repo. All it does is print 3 'Hello!'s in various forms on the OLED display.
# It illustrates how to change the font size and positioning of text on the OLED... As well as showing how to do 
# basic text!
 
# This program was created by The Raspberry Pi Guy!
 
# Imports the necessary libraries... Gaugette 'talks' to the display ;-)
import gaugette.ssd1306
import time
import sys
 
# Setting some variables for our reset pin etc.
RESET_PIN = 15
DC_PIN    = 16
 
# Very important... This lets py-gaugette 'know' what pins to use in order to reset the display
led = gaugette.ssd1306.SSD1306(reset_pin=RESET_PIN, dc_pin=DC_PIN)
led.begin()
led.clear_display() # This clears the display but only when there is a led.display() as well!
 
# led.draw_text2(x-axis, y-axis, whatyouwanttoprint, size) < Understand?
# So led.drawtext2() prints simple text to the OLED display like so:
 
text = 'Hello!'
led.draw_text2(0,0,text,2)
text2 = 'Hello!'
led.draw_text2(0,16,text2,1)
text3 = 'Hello!'
led.draw_text2(32,25,text3,1)
led.display()
